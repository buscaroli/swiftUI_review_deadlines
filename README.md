# swiftUI_review_deadlines
Reviewing SwiftUI: deadlines allows user to save todo-like tasks with a deadline

## Why

I am rewiewing SwiftUI and iOS development in general.

## What

The user can add a todo-like task with associated deadline.
Tasks can be viewed as a list in a separate View and can be Deleted.

## Tech

- SwiftUI
- Date and DateFormatter
- Sheets
- @Environment
- UserDefaults
- @ObservableObject, @ObservedObject, @Published, @StateObject 
- ToolbarItem

## TODO

- Style (mainly focused on reviewing concepts)
- Allow the user to edit the task/deadline
